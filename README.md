## About The Project

This is a number guessing game where you get feedback on whether the secret number is higher or lower. You lose points with each guess, but if you hit it, your point is saved in the highscore, if it is higher than the previous round.

## Built in

1. JavaScript
2. HTML5
3. CSS

## What I learned

With this smaller project, I learned a lot about DOM manipulation and how freedom can be achieved with the help of javascript. I found it exciting how almost everything can be manipulated and thus make even this simple little game even more interactive.

## Acknowledgment

Thanks to everyone who gives feedback on my solution. It definitely helps you find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
